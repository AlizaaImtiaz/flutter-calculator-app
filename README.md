Simple Calculator App
This is a simple calculator app built using Flutter. The app allows the user to input two numbers and perform basic arithmetic operations, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The app provides real-time calculation results, handles input validation, and displays appropriate error messages in case of invalid inputs

Features
Basic Arithmetic Operations: The app supports addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/).

Input Validation:
Alerts the user if any input field is empty or contains non-numeric values.
Handles division by zero and provides an appropriate error message.

UI Components:
Two text fields for entering numbers.
Four buttons for the arithmetic operations.
A "Clear" button to reset the input fields and the result.
Centered UI Elements: The app uses a centered layout for a clean and consistent user experience.

How It Works
User Input: The user enters two numbers in the input fields.
Choose Operation: The user selects one of the four arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /).
Result Calculation: Upon pressing an operation button, the app calculates the result based on the operation selected and displays the result.
Validation: The app checks if both input fields contain valid numbers. If not, an error message is shown.
Clear: Pressing the "Clear" button resets the input fields and the result.
